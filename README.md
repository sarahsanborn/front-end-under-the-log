# Under The Log

## Introduction
Under The Log is an interactive foraging app that shows edible plants and fungi observed by community members in Washington State. Observations are clustered into groups based on proximity. You can zoom in to click on individual observations, which enables a popup that shows a picture of the observation, the common and Latin name, the date the species was observed, if the species is native or not, and a button to get directions to the exact coordinates of the observation. 

If signed in, you can add observations to a favorites list by clicking the heart on a popup. All favorites can be viewed by selecting the See Favorites button. 

You can also filter the observations on the map via the Common Foragables dropdown and find other species via the search bar. 

Under The Log was created by Sarah Sanborn and Tara Alsaidi.
