        <p>Foraging is an ancient and beautiful tradition. When we forage, 
          we tap into the ancestral knowledge of Black and Indigenous 
          communities, who have cared for the land since time immemorial. 
          The process of identifying, harvesting, and preparing wild 
          edibles brings us closer to nature and strengthens our sense 
          of food security and wellness. When foraging, it’s important 
          to know how to forage ethically, sustainably, and safely. 
          Below are several foraging considerations.</p>
        <h2>Land Acknowledgement</h2>
        <p>The Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest have resided 
          on the lands now known as Washington State since time 
          immemorial. For thousands of years, these groups have 
          been integral to the stewardship and conservation of land. 
          They sustainably hunted, gathered, and harvested medicinal 
          plants, foods, and natural resources. We acknowledge and 
          thank them for their countless efforts. We are responsible 
          for recognizing this work and owe our deepest gratitude to 
          the Indigenous people of this region. To learn more about 
          Indigenous lands, we encourage you to consult <a href="https://native-land.ca/">Native Land</a>.</p>
        <h2>Foraging Considerations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Consult with an expert for a positive identification.</b> Even after a positive identification, taste only a small amount as a precaution in the event of an allergic reaction or ill effects caused by misidentification.</li>
          <li><b>Watch a plant through its growth cycle.</b> Get to know what a plant looks like throughout the year to be able to better identify it.</li>
          <li><b>Avoid harvesting from polluted ground</b> such as near roads, farms, or animal droppings.</li>
          <li><b>Be aware of sacred plants to Indigenous cultures</b> and do not use plants in a way that culturally appropriates. For example, Silver Wormwood, also commonly known as white sage, is sacred to many Indigenous peoples, but the burning of sage by non-Indigenous people has led the plant to the brink of extinction.</li>
          <li><b>Respect the plant.</b> Properly harvest as to not kill the plant or cause it undue stress. Consider spreading the plant’s seeds in the area surrounding the plant. Consult an expert on how to best do this. </li>
          <li><b>Practice conservation.</b> Never collect more than you intend to use. Do not pick rare or endangered species. Work with a professional to restore wild plants. Do not plant invasive plants. </li>
          <li><b>Leave no trace.</b> Pick up after yourself, your group, and your pets. </li>
          <li><b>Ask permission from landowners before harvesting.</b> Get a permit if necessary. </li>
          <li><b>Be equipped.</b> Bring water, navigation, sun protection, first aid, food, and extra clothes. </li>
        </ul>
